    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As an administrator for multiple Linux servers in various location, I find it
hard to manage port forwarding in routers, of course you can configure a
remote GUI login such as RDP and VNC but all these servers only enable
services they need with SSH as their main method of remote administration
to these servers. Then, I found out about SSH tunneling, which is a lifesaver.
There are two main method to tunnel traffic through SSH:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/330131/ssh-tunnel-to-home-network-and-access-router-web-interface">Forward a single port through SSH</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Secure_Shell#Encrypted_SOCKS_tunnel">Tunneling through SOCKS</a></li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<p>The first method is good for temporary tunneling and the second method is good
for when you want to encrypt your traffic. So, I think first method is more
suitable to my case, but you are free to use the second method as well.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Forward a single port through SSH</h2>

<p>Make sure you know your router IP before you run SSH command, you can just SSH
into your remote machine to get the default using <code>route</code> command. After you
know your remote router IP, you can configure your tunnel using <code>ssh</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -p [remote ssh port if changed] -L8080:[remote router IP]:80 [username]@[host]
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that you fill in those variables in square brackets. After entering
your user password, you can open your browser and access your router web management
through <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>. Make sure that your firewall/iptables are not blocking port 8080.</p>

<h2>Method 2: Tunneling through SOCKS</h2>

<p>This method forward ports according to the port you specified in your browser
or application. However, it is more complex and usually used to encrypt your
traffic. You create a SOCKS tunnel using <code>ssh</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -TND 4711 [username]@[host]
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that you fill in those variables in square brackets. After entering
your user password, you need to configure your browser to use SOCKS proxy, you
can find more information on how to configure web browser for SOCKS proxy
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Secure_Shell#Encrypted_SOCKS_tunnel">here</a>.
Once configured, you need to enter the router's IP to access the router's web
management interface.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I updated my Linux machine recently and the next thing I know is that bluetooth
keeps crashing with SIGSEGV. By following
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Step_By_Step_Debugging_Guide">this Archlinux wiki's</a>
strace method, I am able to find out that the crash is caused by nothing more
than some missing files.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>All I had to do is removing my device in <code>/var/lib/bluetooth/</code> folder,
but for safety, I renamed it instead:</p>

<pre><code>mv /var/lib/bluetooth/00\:11\:22\:33\:44\:55 /var/lib/bluetooth/00\:11\:22\:33\:44\:55.bak
systemctl restart bluetooth
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that you replace 00:11:22:33:44:55 with your bluetooth device
address, which should be in the directory <code>/var/lib/bluetooth/</code>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>BlueProximity is a great addition to Linux, it adds a little of extra security
for you Linux machine. For those who don't know what it is, here's an excerpt
from BlueProximity:</p>

<p>{% blockquote BlueProximity http://blueproximity.sourceforge.net %}
This software helps you add a little more security to your desktop. It does so
by detecting one of your bluetooth devices, most likely your mobile phone, and
keeping track of its distance. If you move away from your computer and the
distance is above a certain level (no measurement in meters is possible) for a
given time, it automatically locks your desktop (or starts any other shell
command you want).</p>

<p>Once away your computer awaits its master back - if you are nearer than a given
level for a set time your computer unlocks magically without any interaction
(or starts any other shell command you want).
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The problem I found when configuring BlueProximity on my Linux machine is the
commands, if you are on Gnome, nearly no configuration is needed, but I am on
KDE 4.x. So, here's the command I used to get it working on my machine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lock command: <code>qdbus-qt4 org.kde.screensaver /ScreenSaver Lock</code></li>
<li>Unlock command: <code>qdbus-qt4 | grep kscreenlocker_greet | xargs -I {} qdbus-qt4 {} /MainApplication quit</code></li>
<li>Proximity command: <code>qdbus-qt4 org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver SimulateUserActivity</code></li>
</ul>


<p>If you are not using <code>qdbus-qt4</code>, substitute it with <code>qdbus</code>.</p>

    <id>http://ctingwai.github.com/blog/2013/10/09/postfix-mail-relays</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have to setup a mail server to notify me of system failure from Nagios. So, instead of setting the mail server from scratch, I decided to use my company's email as a relay for notification.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Postfix are installed on most distros as the default MTA (Mail Transfer Agent). In cases where it is not installed, you can install by searching for postfix in your package manager, e.g. <code>sudo apt-cache search postfix</code>. Since, I am installing on a Ubuntu 12.04 machine, the instructions here lean more to Ubuntu systems, but it should work with other distros too. Configuration of mail server used to relay email from my Ubuntu machine: \</p>

<pre><code>Incoming server: smtp.domain.com (IMAP = Port 143, POP = Port 110)
Outgoing server: smtp.domain.com (SMTP = Port 587)
</code></pre>

<p>1. Add the following lines to <code>/etc/postfix/main.cnf</code>: \</p>

<pre><code># Settings for relay
relayhost = smtp.domain.com:587
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous, noplaintext
smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = login, plain
smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic 
</code></pre>

<p>2. Add the following lines to /etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd: \</p>

<pre><code>[smtp.domain.com]:587 username:password
</code></pre>

<p>3. Generating sasl_passwd.db file by running the following command: \</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo postfix /etc/sasl/sasl\_passwd
</code></pre>

<p>4. Make sure that only root can read both file:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/sasl/sasl\_passwd*
</code></pre>

<p>5. Restart postfix:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart
</code></pre>

<p>6. Send a test mail:</p>

<pre><code>echo "Testing" | mail -s "Test" email@address.com
</code></pre>

<p>You should receive your email in the address you sent above. If you are not getting an email, check the system mail, email failed to sent will get sent back to your own machine along with some error messages, you can check the system mail by using <code>cat /var/mail/root</code>. Note however, not all mail servers allow mail relays.</p>

    <link href="http://ctingwai.github.com/blog/2013/06/16/playing-multiple-tracks-vcd-on-linux/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-16T13:43:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://ctingwai.github.com/blog/2013/06/16/playing-multiple-tracks-vcd-on-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have bought a VCD movie recently to find that it was not playable on my OpenSUSE, CD2 works fine but not CD1. Then I go back for a replacement disc on the shop and came back to watch it but unfortunately, the problem persist. The problem is that CD1 comtains multiple tracks that most Mediaplayer doesn't support (tried VLC and Kaffeine). So I started to dive into the problems and found a thread that provides useful information on playing VCD on Linux (Refer to references).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Basically there are two ways to work around this problem:<br/>
1. Use MPlayer to play your disc<br/>
2. Rip your VCD using vcdxrip</p>

<h2>1. Use MPlayer to play your dics</h2>

<p>MPlayer was quite new to me actually, it is launched through the console, and it is does not appear in the menu. Here is the command to play VCD using MPlayer (install if you haven't already):</p>

<pre><code>mplayer vcd://&lt;track number&gt; -cdrom-device /dev/&lt;your cd rom device&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you have to substitute <code>&lt;track number&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;your cd rom device&gt;</code> with the track number and your cd rom device. On my machine, it's on track 3 and my cd rom device is either dvd or sr0 (dvd is a symlink to sr0). So my complete command is:</p>

<pre><code>mplayer vcd://3 -cdrom-device /dev/sr0
</code></pre>

<p>Refer to mplayer's manpage for controls and details: <code>man mplayer</code>.</p>

<h2>2. Rip your VCD using vcdxrip</h2>

<p>This has not personally worked for me because it keeps stopping at certain points, it just doesn't copy the whole VCD. But it is still good to know if MPlayer does not work. The command is very easy and straight forward. Remember to change to a directory for your ripped files before executing this command:</p>

<pre><code>vcdxrip -C
</code></pre>

<p>And there will be multiple files present on your currect directory, where you could play using VLC or whatever media player you may wish.</p>
